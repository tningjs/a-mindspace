## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

Each of the commit needs to have a clear commit message, and each commit should accomplish just **ONE** task instead of **MANY**.

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
* Use the following tags as the first part in the title of each commit message. Multiple tags can be applied to the same commit. E.g. `[perf][refa] <MessageTitle>`. Use upper case letter for the first char following by the tag, put a space between. E.g. `[buil] Init project`.
  * `[docs]` - Add / improve documentation
  * `[perf]` - Performance improvemt
  * `[feat]` - New features
  * `[buil]` - Build
  * `[refa]` - Refactor the current code
  * `[fix]` - bug fix
* More to read:
